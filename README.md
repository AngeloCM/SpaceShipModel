<h1>Spaceship Titanic Rescue Project</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our Spaceship Titanic Rescue project! In this cosmic endeavor, we aim to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension after the Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly. Join us as we explore the data and develop a robust predictive model to aid in the rescue of lost passengers.</p>

<h2>Dataset Focus:</h2>
    <p>Spaceship Titanic passenger transport prediction</p>

<h2>Objective:</h2>
    <p>Understand data structure, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models with hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.</p>

<h2>Key Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Explore data structure and variables.</li>
        <li>Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships.</li>
        <li>Develop and optimize predictive models, such as RandomForestClassifier.</li>
        <li>Evaluate model performance and refine for accuracy.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>Create a robust model for predicting which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension, aiding rescue efforts and ensuring their safe return.</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
